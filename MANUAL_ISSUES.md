# Manual GitHub Issues Creation

Please create the following issues in the GitHub repository manually, then close them as they have been completed.

## Issue 1: Implement Request-Level Caching
**Title**: Implement Request-Level Caching
**Labels**: enhancement, performance
**Body**:
```
Implement a thread-safe, async-compatible caching system optimized for API routes with Bloom Housing compatibility.

Key Features:
- Thread-safe operations with asyncio.Lock
- Configurable TTL and cache size
- Automatic LRU eviction
- Metrics tracking
- Bloom Housing compatibility

Implementation in `app/services/storage/route_cache.py`.
```

## Issue 2: Implement Smart Batching for Similar Requests
**Title**: Implement Smart Batching for Similar Requests
**Labels**: enhancement, performance
**Body**:
```
Create a batching system that automatically groups similar small requests to improve processing efficiency.

Key Features:
- Automatic grouping based on request properties
- Adaptive timing control for optimal batch sizes
- Concurrent processing of multiple batches
- Result mapping back to original requesters

Implementation in `app/api/middleware/batch_optimizer.py`.
```

## Issue 3: Add Streaming Response Support
**Title**: Add Streaming Response Support
**Labels**: enhancement, feature
**Body**:
```
Implement streaming responses for large document processing to avoid timeouts.

Key Features:
- Chunk-based processing for large documents
- Event-driven format for client-side progress tracking
- Progress notifications during processing
- Resilience against timeouts for large operations

Implementation in `app/api/routes/streaming.py`.
```

## Issue 4: Enhance Error Handling
**Title**: Enhance Error Handling
**Labels**: enhancement, reliability
**Body**:
```
Implement standardized error categorization with comprehensive fallbacks.

Key Features:
- Categorized errors for better client handling
- Standardized response format
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation
- Request ID tracking for improved debugging

Implementation in `app/utils/error_handler.py`.
```

## Issue 5: Implement Bloom Housing Compatibility
**Title**: Implement Bloom Housing Compatibility
**Labels**: enhancement, integration
**Body**:
```
Create a compatibility layer for seamless integration with Bloom Housing API.

Key Features:
- Compatible schemas for both systems
- Bidirectional conversion of request/response formats
- Transparent processing with core pipeline

Implementation in:
- `app/api/schemas/bloom_housing.py`
- `app/api/routes/bloom_housing.py`
```

## Issue 6: Implement Parallel Processing
**Title**: Implement Parallel Processing
**Labels**: enhancement, performance
**Body**:
```
Add concurrent execution of independent tasks to improve throughput.

Key Features:
- Parallel preprocessing using asyncio.gather
- Non-blocking I/O throughout the API stack
- Background tasks for metrics and logging

Implementation in modified `app/api/routes/pipeline.py`.
```

## Issue 7: Add Comprehensive Tests
**Title**: Add Comprehensive Tests
**Labels**: testing, quality
**Body**:
```
Create tests for all new optimizations to ensure reliability.

Key Features:
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API
- Component tests for basic functionality
- Documentation for testing

Implementation in `app/tests/` directory.
```

After creating these issues, please mark them all as closed since the implementation is already complete and has been pushed to the repository.
