## Next Steps

The project is now ready for deployment to GitHub. You can use the provided `push_to_github.sh` script to either:

1. Push to the existing GitHub repository (wize73-ai/casMay4)
2. Create a new GitHub repository and push the code there

After pushing to GitHub, you should:

1. Set up branch protection rules
2. Configure required GitHub Actions secrets
3. Enable GitHub Pages for documentation hosting
4. Configure review requirements for pull requests
