## Quality Assurance Process

CasaLingua ensures high quality through a multi-stage process:

1. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Selection of state-of-the-art base models
   - Fine-tuning for specific domains and tasks
   - Continuous evaluation against benchmarks

2. **Runtime Verification**
   - Veracity auditing for each processing request
   - Automatic issue detection and classification
   - Optional auto-fixing of detected issues

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Collection of quality metrics across requests
   - Regular review and analysis of system performance
   - Feedback loop for model and system improvements

4. **Domain-Specific Adaptations**
   - Specialized handling for legal text
   - Housing-specific terminology management
   - Regular updates to domain knowledge

## Key Technologies

The quality assurance system leverages several key technologies:

- **Embedding-based Semantic Similarity**: For meaning preservation verification
- **Statistical Analysis**: For length ratios and other statistical metrics
- **Domain-Specific Dictionaries**: For terminology verification
- **Readability Formulas**: For evaluating simplification effectiveness

## Usage

Quality verification can be enabled on-demand for any processing request by setting the appropriate parameters:

- For translations: `verify: true`
- For simplifications: `verify_output: true, auto_fix: true`

Results of verification are included in the API response and can be used to:

1. Filter out low-quality outputs
2. Provide feedback to end users
3. Collect metrics for system improvement

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter quality issues with CasaLingua's outputs, please report them through the appropriate channels:

1. For API users: Include `report_quality_issue: true` in your API request
2. For administrative users: Use the quality management dashboard
3. For developers: Submit a detailed issue report in the issue tracker
