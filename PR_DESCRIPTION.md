Repository: [wize73-ai/casMay4](https://github.com/wize73-ai/casMay4)

## Summary
- Fixed critical model loading issues that prevented server startup
- Created proper model registry configuration with correct model classes
- Fixed scope issues with transformer imports to prevent UnboundLocalError
- Ensured all models use the correct classes for their intended tasks
