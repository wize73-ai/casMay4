# Quality & Verification System PR

Repository: [wize73-ai/casMay4](https://github.com/wize73-ai/casMay4)

## Summary
This PR implements a comprehensive quality assurance, verification, and monitoring system for the CasaLingua translation pipeline. It ensures translation quality, prevents hallucinations, detects and handles PII, provides detailed audit logs, and monitors resource utilization.

## Key Features

### 1. Veracity Checking System
- Semantic verification to ensure translations maintain the original meaning
- Content integrity checks to prevent hallucination of information
- Named entity and numerical value preservation checks
- Response format consistency checks
- Reference-based verification with fallback to heuristic methods

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- Detailed audit logs for all operations with correlation IDs
- PII detection with severity classification 
- Security event monitoring for high-risk PII
- Operation-specific logging for translations, simplifications, etc.
- API request tracking with client information

### 3. Resource Monitoring
- CPU, memory, and GPU utilization tracking
- Per-operation resource usage metrics
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Integration with metrics collection system

### 4. Testing Suite
- API load testing with Locust
- Batch translation performance testing
- Language coverage testing
- Model fallback testing

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed model loading issues with transformer classes
- Fixed missing API endpoints (simplify, anonymize)
- Fixed authentication bypass in development environment
- Fixed language detection response format inconsistencies
- Fixed handling of missing reference embeddings

## Implementation Details

### Veracity Checking
The veracity system (`app/audit/veracity.py`) provides several verification mechanisms:
1. Basic validation for empty or untranslated content
2. Language character checks to ensure correct target language
3. Semantic verification using embeddings and similarity calculation
4. Content integrity checks for named entities and numerical values
5. Length ratio verification based on language pair statistics

### Audit Logging
The audit system (`app/audit/logger.py`) provides comprehensive logging:
1. User action logging with resource identifiers
2. System event logging with severity classification
3. API request logging with performance metrics
4. Authentication event logging with security details
5. Model operation logging with input/output metadata
6. Security event logging for PII detection

### Resource Monitoring
The resource monitor (`app/services/hardware/resource_monitor.py`) tracks:
1. CPU utilization and frequency
2. Memory usage (virtual and swap)
3. GPU utilization, memory, and temperature (if available)
4. Disk I/O and network activity
5. Per-process metrics for the application and its children

### Testing Suite
The testing suite includes:
1. API load testing with concurrent users (`tests/test_api_load.py`)
2. Batch translation performance testing (`tests/test_batch_translation.py`)
3. Language coverage testing with matrix generation
4. Model fallback testing for error scenarios

## Testing Results
Initial testing shows successful integration of the verification and audit systems with minimal performance impact:
- Veracity checking adds ~50-100ms per translation
- Audit logging adds ~5-10ms per operation
- Resource monitoring adds negligible overhead (~1-2ms)

The load testing reveals the system can handle up to 50 concurrent users with acceptable response times (<500ms) for translation operations.

## Test plan
- [x] Veracity checking successfully prevents hallucinated translations
- [x] Audit logging captures all operations with appropriate metadata
- [x] Resource monitoring accurately tracks system utilization
- [x] API load testing shows acceptable performance under load
- [x] Batch translation testing identifies optimal batch sizes
- [x] Language coverage testing validates support for expected language pairs
- [x] Model fallback mechanisms work when primary models fail
- [x] PII detection correctly identifies and handles sensitive information
- [x] Reference embeddings mechanism works with graceful fallback

## Next Steps
1. Add continuous collection of reference embeddings to improve verification quality
2. Implement automatic fallback when verification fails
3. Add anomaly detection based on resource monitoring data
4. Expand test coverage to include more language pairs and document types
