# Fix Model Loading and API Issues in CasaLingua Pipeline

Repository: [wize73-ai/casMay4](https://github.com/wize73-ai/casMay4)

## Summary
- Fixed critical model loading issues that prevented server startup
- Created proper model registry configuration with correct model classes
- Fixed scope issues with transformer imports to prevent UnboundLocalError
- Ensured all models use the correct classes for their intended tasks
- Fixed health endpoints to properly report model registry status
- Fixed authentication bypass for development mode
- Added development environment setup helpers
- Implemented direct model testing capability independent of API endpoints
- Fixed language detection response format to include required fields
- Implemented missing API endpoints for text simplification and anonymization
- Added comprehensive API endpoint testing tools

## Test Results
All models now load properly with their correct classes:
- ✅ Translation: Working correctly
- ✅ Simplifier (T5): Fixed using T5ForConditionalGeneration model class
- ✅ NER Detection: Working correctly
- ✅ RAG Generator: Working correctly
- ✅ Anonymizer: Working correctly
- ✅ Language Detection: Fixed response format to include detected_language key

All API endpoints now accessible:
- ✅ `/pipeline/translate`: Working correctly
- ✅ `/pipeline/detect`: Working correctly
- ✅ `/pipeline/simplify`: Implemented and working
- ✅ `/pipeline/anonymize`: Implemented and working
- ✅ `/pipeline/analyze`: Working correctly
- ✅ `/pipeline/summarize`: Working correctly

## Test plan
- [x] Server starts up successfully with all models loaded
- [x] Health endpoints report all models as healthy
- [x] Translation endpoint works with auth bypass in development mode
- [x] Health/detailed endpoint now returns proper 200 status
- [x] Model registry properly reports available models
- [x] Hardware detection and model configuration works for Apple Silicon
- [x] Development mode can be easily set with included script
- [x] Added test_direct_model_calls.py for testing models directly without API
- [x] Fixed language detection response format to match expected output
- [x] Implemented missing API endpoints for text simplification and anonymization
- [x] Added comprehensive API endpoint testing tools (both Python and shell script)
